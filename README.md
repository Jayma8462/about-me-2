Question 4 problem where it would double prompt for the same Question
  -removed the prompt for the wife question on line 62
  -added in the wide question on line 70 so just in case the user gets the question wrong it will re prompt the questions so the while look does no infinitly alert for the no input or no answer.
  -did the same for the else at the end added line 74. Allows the question to re prompt the question to the while loop can go to a different if statement.
  -No other changes made to fix the problem with it double prompting.
